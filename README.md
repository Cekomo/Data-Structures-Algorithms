AlgorithmSortAll and AlgorithmSortK, AlgorithmSortHeap and AlgorithmSortQuick takes a text file as input and prints the i'th number as output. 
The main goal here is to illustrate the algorithm sorting time differences in different cases.
Bear in mind that first 3 line of the text file must include respectively: algorithm type (1, 2, 3 and 4), i'th number, how many numbers the text file includes.
